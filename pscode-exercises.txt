// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

num1 = 1
num2 = 2
num1 + num 2 = Sum
Sum = 3

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


Print "Enter Any Number to Check, Even or Odd"
Read input of a numberIf number mod = 0
Print "Number is Even"
Else
Print "Number is Odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

nput n1, n2, n3, n4, n5

avg = (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5)/5

small = n1

large = n1

for i = 2 to 5:

   if n1 > ni then:

       small = ni

   if n1 < ni: then:

       large = ni

print("Average:", avg)

print("Smallest:", small)

print("Largest:", large)
